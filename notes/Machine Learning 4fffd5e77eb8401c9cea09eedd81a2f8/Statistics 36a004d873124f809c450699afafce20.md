## Measures of Central Tendancy

Mean is the average value of the dataset. Median is the middle value of an ordered dataset.

Median is more useful than mean because mean can vary widely due to one value that is lot larger/smaller than others.

## Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a measure of how spread the data is. Standard deviation  is the square root of variance. 

If standard deviation is 17.1 and mean is 33.1, values that are within one standard deviation is said to be between (33.1-17.1) and (33.1+17.1)

Low standard deviation means values tend to be close to the mean and vise versa
