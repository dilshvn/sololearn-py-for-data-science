# NumPy (Numerical Python)

To use NumPy, first import the library

```jsx
import numpy as np
```

## NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than lists. They are homogeneous, meaning only single data type elements can be stored. NumPy array can be created as follows

```jsx
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

Their elements can be accessed using indexes

```jsx
print(x[0])
```

NumPy arrays are called ndarrays, meaning ‘N-dimensional arrays’, because they can have multiple dimensions

```jsx
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(x[1][2])
```

This is a 2d array which has 3 rows and 3 columns

## NumPy Array Properties

```jsx
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

print(x.ndim) # 2
print(x.size) # 9
print(x.shape) # (3, 3)
```

ndim returns number of dimensions of array. size returns total number of elements of array. 

shape returns a tuple of integers that indicate the number of elements stored in each dimension of the array. Here, (3, 3) means 3 rows and 3 columns in this 2d array.

We can add, remove and sort using np.append(), np.delete(), and np.sort()

```jsx
import numpy as np

x = np.array([2, 1, 3])

x = np.append(x, 4)
x = np.delete(x, 0)
x = np.sort(x)

print(x) #[1 3 4]
```

np.delete() deletes the element of the given index and np.append() appends the given element

np.arange() creates an array that has a range of numbers similar to python range

```jsx
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(2, 10, 3)
print(x) #[2 5 8]
```
